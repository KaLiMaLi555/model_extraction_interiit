Files
    Common MARS Model file (can keep common with greybox or add to our models)

    DFME
	DFME models -> One file. VideoGAN and ImageGenerator, Student: CNNLSTM for Video, MARS (see above) and MobileNet for img
	DFME Grad approx -> Common file, separate functions(?)
	DFME pipeline -> Common file or 1 for movi and 1 for swin?

    cGAN
	cGAN Models -> One file. GeneratorC, Student: MARS, Mobilenet?
	cGAN Pretrainer -> Common file or 1 for movi and 1 for swin?
	cGAN Dataset Gen -> Common file (can have a common utils file for loading cGAN checkpoint with pipeline)
	CGAN student pipeline -> Common file or 1 for movi and 1 for swin?
	Grad approx files from DFME (can keep common or replicate. Imports might be ugly if common)
