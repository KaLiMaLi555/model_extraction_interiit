Files
[ ] Common MARS Model file (can keep common with greybox?)
[X] Common Grad Approx -> Common file for swin and movi

    DFME
[X] DFME models -> One file. VideoGAN and ImageGenerator, Student: ResCNNLSTM for Video, MARS (common) and MobileNet for img
[ ] DFME pipeline -> Common file. Need to handle 2 teachers and 2 cases (img/vid). Options for student

    cGAN
[X] cGAN Models -> One file. GeneratorC, Student: MARS (common)
[ ] cGAN Pretrainer -> Common file (diff teachers, both with same GeneratorC)
[ ] cGAN Dataset Gen -> Common file (can have a common utils file for loading cGAN checkpoint with pipeline)
[ ] CGAN student pipeline -> Common file
